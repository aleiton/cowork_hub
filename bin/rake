# =============================================================================
# RAKE BINSTUB
# =============================================================================
#
# Rake is Ruby's build automation tool, similar to Make in C/C++.
# It's used in Rails for running tasks like:
#   - rake db:migrate (run database migrations)
#   - rake db:seed (load seed data)
#   - rake routes (list all routes)
#   - rake -T (list all available tasks)
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
# This binstub ensures that when you run `bin/rake` or `bundle exec rake`,
# you're using the correct version of Rake that's bundled with this project,
# not a system-wide version that might be different.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. Loads config/boot.rb which sets up Bundler and the gem environment
# 2. Requires the Rake library
# 3. Runs Rake with any command-line arguments you passed
#
# =============================================================================

require_relative '../config/boot'
require 'rake'
Rake.application.run
